Word order py

Output  lines. 
On the first line, output the number of distinct words from the input. 
On the second line, output the number of occurrences
for each distinct word according to their appearance
in the input.
 
 You are given  words. Some words may repeat. 
 For each word, output its number of occurrences. 
 The output order should correspond with the input 
 order of appearance of the word. See the sample
 input/output for clarification.
