/*Program below does the following: it asks for a letter to be guessed. If guess is incorrect, then it exits the console. If
  guess is correct then the program continues on until another time the user guesses incorrectly. It is rudimentary because It is missing
  a looping statement that will be able to get the user to enter a value over and over again until they guess correctly. This is because
  I already have a program that does that and I am too lazy to do it for c++ since do while loops don't work here lol
