 *C++ Program
 *The following program prompts the user to enter any character and then,
 *converts it to uppercase using ascii code. It then prints out,
 *the DEC part of the user input character.
 *When a user enters anything other than a lower case character, the DEC,
 *in ascii is subtracted by 32 and in place of the upper case, a different,
 character takes its place depending on the character that the user inputs
 *When the user inputs a whitespace, it is treated as a character and
 *the program prints it out in place of the character that the user
 *inputs after the space.
